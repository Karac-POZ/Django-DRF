# Django DRF API - A RESTful API Built with Django and Django Rest Framework

## Overview
This project is a web development exercise that demonstrates the use of Django as a backend framework and Django Rest Framework (DRF) for building a robust RESTful API. The goal was to create a fully functional API that can handle user authentication, CRUD operations on resources, and provide a suitable structure for further development.

### Key Features:

*   **User Authentication**: Supports username/password-based login and JWT token-based authentication.
*   **Resource Management**: Provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) users and products.
*   **API Documentation**: Includes Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for easy API discovery and usage.

### Technical Details:

*   **Backend Framework**: Utilizes Django 3.x as the primary backend framework for its flexibility and robustness.
*   **API Framework**: Leverages Django Rest Framework (DRF) to handle serialization, pagination, and other API-related functionality efficiently.
*   **Database**: Connects to a PostgreSQL database using the `psycopg2` library for seamless integration.
